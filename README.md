### Natural Language Computing

```Tweet Classifier``` <br>
* Split the tweets into sentences
* Tag them with a PoS tagger provided
* Gather some feature information from each tweet
* Use this information in machine learning classifiers that
estimate the Twitter account (i.e., the twit) that produced a given tweet
<br><br>

```Statistical Machine Translation``` <br>
* Build bigram and unigram models of English and French, to smooth their probabilities using add-δ discounting
* Build a world-alignment model between English and French using the IBM-1 model
* Use these models to translate French sentences into English with a decoder
<br><br>

```Speech Recognition``` <br>
* Experiment with speaker identification by training mixtures of Gaussians to the acoustic characteristics of individual speakers
* Identify unknown speakers based on these models.
* Experiment with speech recognition by training hidden Markov models, and analyzing system’s performance with word-error rates
